1) How is this different from Microsoft AntiXSS library?

Microsoft's AntiXSS library is excellent. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite fill the niche that AntiSamy does. AntiXSS is about preventing rich
content from getting through - AntiSamy is about filtering _dangerous_ rich content.

  - AntiSamy allows you to specify tags and attributes to be valid (and whitelist regular expressions for attribute values)
  - AntiSamy allows you to filter or remove dangerous content at the tag or attribute level
  - AntiSamy automatically santiizes any broken HTML to prevent fragmenting attacks
  - AntiSamy provides helpful error messages
  - AntiSamy works on a document fragment level (produces XHTML 1.0)
  - AntiXSS doesn't understand style sheets

2) How do I build the code?

  - Get the code from the SVN repository on GoogleCode (http://code.google.com/p/owaspantisamy) or download the source bundle directly
  - Add the ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar to your set of ant libraries to support the "foreach" task used in our build.xml
  - Fire off the appropriate build.xml ant task (jar, src, javadocs, etc)
  - Profit

3) Why are you using (X)HTMLSerializers which have been deprecated?

The developers in the Apache group has no plans on an end of life on HTMLSerializer. They just wanted people to know that it is no longer being maintained
and getting bug fixes, etc. They're in the middle of a move to an xml-commons project. Once that is established, they inferred there will be an alternative
available. It's not a deprecation to be scared of - they just want to get your attention that it's not being maintained. It does what AntiSamy needs it to
do, so if a better alternative comes along, great, but we can just use this version forever even if they end-of-life it.
